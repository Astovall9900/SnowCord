# SnowCord
 This web application is a discord clone but with improvements to the UI and Backend Architecture.
 
 Discord is an application that handles millions of messages/images and requests a second while also supporting low latency video and audio transmitting.
 
 Snowcord replicates this on a minute scale to demonstrate the capabilities of a lightweight react application.
 
 Technologies Used:
 React + Redux - FE
 Firebase - DB / Backend
