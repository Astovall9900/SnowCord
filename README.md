## Documentation

Discord is an application that handles millions of messages/images and requests a second while also supporting low latency video and audio transmitting.

Snowcord replicates this as a lightweight, responsive, scalable communication application. 

Discord, Teams, and Slack are all used for this purpose, but they are not open source.

## Development Setup

This application is for fullstack developers to learn react frontend styling and component creation, NPM package management, webpack, and backend development (most of it is handled in the cloud by firebase)

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js] which includes [Node Package Manager][npm]

### Setting Up a Project

Install React globally:

```
npm install -g @react
```

Install NPM packages / dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run the development server

```
cd [PROJECT NAME]
npm run start
```

### MACOS Users

You might have to either enable permissions for your project directory for vscode (or your editor)

Otherwise you will get access error. Also if NPM is giving you issues in the terminal make sure you run the command as 

``sudo npm [blah blah]``

so you run as administrator.

## Firebase

Firebase has extremely good documentation if you are wondering how to set up the database

This database setup can be replicated on AWS, Azure or Firebase.
